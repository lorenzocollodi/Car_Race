# Car_Race
A simple game in C simulating a car race I developed as a university project using Allegro. 

# How to use
After downloading the files run make inside the main repository, then run ./main inside the bin folder that is created.

The game is very simple and the instructions are shown plainly in the main menu. When the race is started the user can drive one car (if autopilot is off) by using the r/l arrow keys to steer, the space bar to accelerate and the down key to brake and drive in reverse. The car can be paused by pressing P and when paused the user can return to the menu by pressing M.
